# fancydvdlogo
A fancy version of bouncing DVD logo that I made in JavaScript

## To do

Add fun features like:

* Logo flying out when it hits corner
* Changing background color when hit border

And more like that! You can make your own proposals if you want!

Bugs to fix:

* An SVG image is copy-and-pasted to the webpage's code because I don't know of a solution to change the logo fill inside an `<object>` tag.
* An option box that's doesn't fit to text
* An option box doesn't seem to open once you hover over the button, so I made detect over a certain area instead.

If you can solve this problem, I would be very grateful. <3
